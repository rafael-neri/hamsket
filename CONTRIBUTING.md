### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite                                                                                           | Version |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)          | `=8.0` |
| [Sencha](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/) - install it with the Compass extension  | `~6.7` |
| [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)                                                        | `>2.3, < 3.0` |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)                                                                          | `>=14.0.0` |

> _Updating to the latest releases is recommended_.

If Node.js, ruby, or sencha cmd is already installed on your machine, run the following commands to validate the versions:

```shell
java -version
sencha
ruby -v
node -v
```

If your versions are lower than the prerequisite versions, you should update.

### Forking the Project

#### Setting Up Your System

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or your favorite Git client.
2. (Optional) [Setup an SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/) for GitHub.

#### Forking Hamsket

1. Go to the top level hamsket repository: <https://github.com/TheGoddessInari/hamsket>
2. Click the "Fork" Button in the upper right hand corner of the interface ([More Details Here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
3. After the repository (repo) has been forked, you will be taken to your copy of the hamsket repo at <https://github.com/yourUsername/hamsket>

#### Cloning Your Fork

1. Open a Terminal / Command Line / Bash Shell in your projects directory (_i.e.: `/yourprojectdirectory/`_)
2. Clone your fork of Hamsket

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/hamsket.git
```

**(make sure to replace `yourUsername` with your GitHub username)**

This will download the entire Hamsket repo to your projects directory.

#### Setup Your Upstream

1. Change directory to the new Hamsket directory (`cd hamsket`)
2. Add a remote to the official Hamsket repo:

```shell
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheGoddessInari/hamsket.git
```

Congratulations, you now have a local copy of the Hamsket repo!

### Create a Branch

Before you start working, you will need to create a separate branch specific to the issue / feature you're working on. You will push your work to this branch.

#### Naming Your Branch

Name the branch something like `fix/xxx` or `feature/xxx` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are attempting to add. For example

`fix/email-login` would be a branch where you fix something specific to email login.

#### Adding Your Branch

To create a branch on your local machine (and switch to this branch):

```shell
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

and to push to GitHub:

```shell
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

**If you need more help with branching, take a look at [this](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches).**

### Set Up Hamsket

Once you have Hamsket cloned, before you start the application, you first need to install all of the dependencies:

```bash
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install
```

```bash
$ npm start # in a new terminal
```

### Make Changes

This bit is up to you!

#### How to find the code in the Hamsket codebase to fix/edit

The best way to find out any code you wish to change/add or remove is using
the GitHub search bar at the top of the repository page. For example, you could
search for a challenge name and the results will display all the files along
with line numbers. Then you can proceed to the files and verify this is the area
that you were looking forward to edit. Always feel free to reach out to the chat
room when you are not certain of any thing specific in the code.

#### Adding or Editing Services

The services are stored inside the file `./app/store/ServicesList.js`.  Add your service to the *BOTTOM* of the array.

The logo it's referencing is located in `./resources/icons/`.

To see these changes you'll need to stop your `npm start` , and then rerun.

### Creating a Pull Request

#### What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR) is a method of submitting proposed changes to the Hamsket
repo (or any repo, for that matter). You will make changes to copies of the
files which make up Hamsket in a personal fork, then apply to have them
accepted by Hamsket proper.

#### Important: ALWAYS EDIT ON A BRANCH

Take away only one thing from this document: Never, **EVER**
make edits to the `master` branch. ALWAYS make a new branch BEFORE you edit
files. This is critical, because if your PR is not accepted, your copy of
`master` will be forever sullied and the only way to fix it is to delete your
fork and re-fork.

### Common Steps

1.  Once the edits have been committed, you will be prompted to create a pull
    request on your fork's GitHub Page.

2.  By default, all pull requests should be against the Hamsket main repo, `master`
    branch.
    **Make sure that your Base Fork is set to TheGoddessInari/hamsket when raising a Pull Request.**

3.  Submit a pull request.

4.  The title (also called the subject) of your PR should be descriptive of your
    changes and succinctly indicates what is being fixed.

    -   **Do not add the issue number in the PR title or commit message.**

    -   Examples: `Added Service servicename` `Correct typo in menu`

5.  In the body of your PR include a more detailed summary of the changes you
    made and why.

    -   If the PR is meant to fix an existing bug/issue then, at the end of
        your PR's description, append the keyword `closes` and #xxxx (where xxxx
        is the issue number). Example: `closes #1337`. This tells GitHub to
        close the existing issue, if the PR is merged.

6.  Indicate if you have tested on a local copy of the site or not.

#### If your PR is accepted

Once your PR is accepted, you may delete the branch you created to submit it.
This keeps your working fork clean.

You can do this with a press of a button on the GitHub PR interface. You can
delete the local copy of the branch with: `git branch -D branch/to-delete-name`

#### If your PR is rejected

Don't despair! You should receive solid feedback as to
why it was rejected and what changes are needed.

Many Pull Requests, especially first Pull Requests, require correction or
updating. If you have used the GitHub interface to create your PR, you will need
to close your PR, create a new branch, and re-submit.

If you have a local copy of the repo, you can make the requested changes and
amend your commit with: `git commit --amend` This will update your existing
commit. When you push it to your fork you will need to do a force push to
overwrite your old commit: `git push --force`

Be sure to post in the PR conversation that you have made the requested changes.

### Building an installer

```shell
npm install
npm run repack:win64
```

You can substitute `win64` for `linux32`, `linux64`, `win32`, or `osx` as desired. This will create an unpacked directory in '**dist**' for testing.

```shell
npm run setup
```

This step instead of **repack** will create an installer appropriate to your platform in '**dist**'.
You can place unpacked files over where the installers normally place their files for development/testing purposes (eg `/Applications` folder in macOS).

**NOTE:** 32-bit builds are **deprecated** by electron-builder and are likely to be removed at some point in the future.
