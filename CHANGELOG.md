>Overhaul badge updating.We've completely overhauled badge updates by introducinga callable function which should cover the standard case.We also allow separate custom JS and JS just for badge updates.We also make the service editing box taller by default.We fix the logging for injected stuff to actually remain accurate.And replace each js_unread in each service with modernized version.We allow for separate custom badge updates and custom JS toavoid doing unnecessary title event hooking allow overrides in asensible order.Also remove Yahoo messenger service, as it was shutdown earlier inJuly.
